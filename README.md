# What is this?
It's very tedious to manually type out this effect to mock your friends. Therefore, I made this tool to help you do it!. This is the source code for the website.

# About
This is basically a web version of [this project](https://github.com/ShubhamPatilsd/UpperLowerCaseTextMaker), which was made in Java. That meant that you needed some form of Java installed. Now, with my newly acquired web skills, you can access this from any device given that it has a web browser.
